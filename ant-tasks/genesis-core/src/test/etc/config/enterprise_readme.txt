Any enterprise managed by Genesis should be defined here in this
directory by creating directories named after them.

The directory names should reflect real enterprise names. Avoid acronyms and 
abbreviations. Choose an identifier naming convention and maintain
consistency for all your enterprise names, for example we will use
UpperCamelCase for our naming convention.

If you have to use acronyms and abbreviations include a file with the
complete names in this direcory or add them to this readme.

The common.xml file in this directory should contain those
properties that are shared among all your enterprises.

The enterprise.xml file in the enterprise directory contains the
properties that are specific to that enterprise.
